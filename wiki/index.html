    <h1>Index of Social Responsibility (ISR): System Overview</h1>
    <h3>A comprehensive framework for transforming group decision-making through personalized weighted voting, ethical AI, and community-defined values.</h3>

    <p>The <b>Index of Social Responsibility (ISR)</b> is a <b>comprehensive framework</b> designed to evaluate and promote socially responsible practices across various sectors. It aims to provide a standardized measure of how organizations, governments, and individuals contribute to the well-being of society and the environment.</p>

    <p>The ISR encompasses multiple dimensions of social responsibility, including <b>ethical governance, environmental sustainability, community engagement</b>, and <b>economic equity</b>. By assessing these factors, the ISR seeks to encourage <b>transparency, accountability</b>, and <b>positive impact</b> in all areas of operation.</p>

    <p>Organizations can utilize the ISR to benchmark their performance against industry standards, identify areas for <b>improvement</b>, and communicate their commitment to social responsibility to stakeholders. The ISR also serves as a valuable tool for consumers and investors who prioritize <b>ethical considerations</b> in their decision-making processes.</p>

    <p>Overall, the Index of Social Responsibility represents a significant step towards <b>fostering a more equitable and sustainable future</b> by promoting responsible behavior at all levels of society.</p>

    <p>The Index of Social Responsibility (ISR) is a practical system for improving collective decisions in groups where membership is equal but responsibilities, expertise and contributions differ (for example: non-profits, homeowners' associations, cooperatives, civic DAOs and other community organizations).</p>

    <h3>The Challenge: Why Traditional Voting Falls Short</h3>
    Community associations face persistent governance challenges that standard one-person-one-vote systems cannot address:
    <ul>
      <li>Membership Dynamics & Bureaucratic Inertia. As membership changes—people joining, leaving, or becoming inactive—formal governance structures fail to adapt. Decisions end up made by whoever happens to be visible rather than whoever is genuinely invested or capable.</li>
      <li>Centralization of Power. As communities grow, decision-making authority concentrates among a small leadership group, while ordinary members retain only periodic voting rights. This breeds populism, reduces accountability, and disconnects leaders from actual member needs and values.</li>
      <li>Expertise Ignored. Simple majority voting discounts expertise and track record, often leading to decisions that squander resources or create poor outcomes.</li>
      <li>Vocal Minorities Dominate. The loudest or most numerous voices outweigh knowledgeable contributors, disadvantaging careful experts in favor of political operators.</li>
      <li>Engagement Collapse. Members with real, context-specific experience and a history of concrete contributions feel unheard, so they disengage. Why participate if neither your expertise nor your actual work for the community has any visible impact?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Solution: How ISR Transforms Community Decision-Making</h3>
    ISR addresses these challenges by linking contribution, competence, and contextual relevance to actual decision influence. Key benefits include:
    <ul>
      <li>Accountability & Genuine Participation. ISR creates a transparent, bidirectional link between what members contribute (skills, actions, values alignment) and their influence on decisions. This framework rewards genuine engagement over passive participation, and discourages political theater.</li>
      <li>Expertise Recognized, Contribution Rewarded. Members with relevant domain expertise and a constructive track record gain proportionally greater voice on decisions within their competence area. Simultaneously, members with high ambitions but low knowledge or contribution history have appropriately moderated influence—ensuring critical decisions benefit from genuine expertise rather than political capital.</li>
      <li>Faster, Better, More Legitimate Decisions. By weighting voices according to criteria the community itself chooses, ISR accelerates decision-making, improves quality through expertise recognition, and increases legitimacy because reasoning is transparent and auditable.</li>
      <li>Transparency & Auditability. Every member can see exactly why certain participants carried more influence on a given issue—what expertise was recognized, what track record was considered, what values were weighted. No black boxes.</li>
      <li>Distributed Decision Ownership. Decision authority stays with the community through issue-specific microcommunities rather than concentrating in leadership. This reduces deadlock while keeping power distributed.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Core concept</h3>
        <p>
          ISR (Index of Social Responsibility) is a context-aware influence score computed for each participant with respect to a specific question or issue. That score (the ISR) is then used to weight that participant's vote or influence in the decision for that issue. ISR is not a permanent power held by the few — it is dynamic, issue-specific and transparent to participants.
          <div class="formula">
            $$ISR = f(Relevance, Expertise, Contribution)$$
          </div>
        </p>

        <h3>Implementation (MVP)</h3>
        <p>
          The minimum deployable product is a web application that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>lets communities declare their shared values and choose weighting parameters;</li>
          <li>lets people create profiles (skills, experience, declared values, activity history);</li>
          <li>forms dynamic microcommunities around concrete issues and proposes relevant participants;</li>
          <li>calculates ISR scores for the issue and uses those scores in weighted voting;</li>
          <li>logs decisions, tasks and execution progress; and</li>
          <li>provides explainability: members can inspect why a score was assigned and which factors mattered most.</li>
        </ul>

          The ISR MVP focuses on workflows that matter for community decisions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Profile:</strong> flexible profile fields, declared values and skills (used in expertise scoring).</li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> each user notes their own values in the most convenient of several possible ways (the system helps in determining and explains the impact and meaning of each item).</li>
          <li><strong>Chat & Discussion:</strong> threaded debates with light reactions; messages contribute to ISR as evidence of contribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Voting:</strong> issues with proposed options, deadlines, and ISR-weighted voting results.</li>
          <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> implementation tracker created after decisions: evidence of completed tasks increases contribution scores.</li>
          <li><strong>AI assistant:</strong> helps users on every step and explain ISR computations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This product design emphasizes transparency, guided AI assistance, and clear links between decisions and executed tasks.

            <p>Registering in the system demands <b>Proof of Identyty</b> use to be sure the person identity, for example, with <b>Bank.ID</b>. The crusial point of the system that every single person can have <b>only one account</b> which logs all social actions of the person.</p>
            <p><b>Profile</b> provide an ability to state all the person major social features:</p>
            <ul>

            <li><b>Action log.</b> Automatically adds all member's social activity both "real" (or "hard", objective) - that has some direct physical results and "virtual" (or "soft", subjective) - communication style, rspectfulness, tollerance. Also it is possible to add some untracked actions through the Profile with AI checking (also may need other people approval). Every record consists of:
              <ul>
                <li>(Optional) Reference to a question in <b>Chat</b> or <b>Voting</b>.</li>

              <div id="content-vectorization" class="content sch-block-g" style="display: none;">
                <p><b>Social connections</b> data is represented as a <b>graph structure</b> where nodes are users and edges represent relationships (friendship, collaboration, communication frequency, etc.). Graph embedding techniques (e.g., Node2Vec, GraphSAGE) are applied to convert this graph data into vector representations that capture the structural and relational properties of users within the social network.</p>
                <p>All other Profile data is also converted into vector representation in semantic space using LLM-based embedding models and saved into vector DB. This vector representation is used in calculating <b>Relevance</b>, <b>Expertise</b> and <b>Contribution</b> - all components of the ISR.
\[
\begin{align*}
\vec{v}_f = m \cdot \vec{d}_f
\end{align*}
\]
where:
<li>\(\vec{v}_f\) - vector representation of user profile fact <b>f</b> (personal data, graph data, education credentials, work experience, actions) </li>
<li>\(\vec{d}_f\) - user profile fact vector semantic <b>direction</b></li>
<li>\(m\) - scalar that shows <b>"force"</b> of the recorded fact (distance for graph data, degree for education, years for experience, scale for actions)</li>
</p>
                <p>The system <b>translates</b> any input form of values into a <b>single vector representation</b>, which is taken into account when compiling the <b>Vector of Values</b> of microcommunities. The participant can change his values, but if this happens often and very sharply, the system will analyze such actions for attempts at manipulation in order to influence specific issues and warn that such actions (inconsistency and opportunism in declaring values) can lead to a decrease in the overall influence of the participant.</p>
                <p>The system, using an AI assistant, provides participants with the opportunity to translate <b>one form into another</b> (for example, a list of parameters into a narrative text and vice versa), and also <b>explains</b> in what sense the system perceives the concepts used to describe values and what <b>impact</b> individual elements have on social actions and their assessment.</p>
                <p>So, at the operational level, the values of the participants are an <b>array of vector representations</b> in a specialized database.</p>

            <p>The formation of a <b>microcommunity</b> around the question <b>q</b> is based on methods of analyzing graphs of geographical, gynecological, social, economic, etc. user connectivity.

                  ISR forms short-lived microcommunities automatically. A microcommunity is a set of relevant stakeholders gathered to deliberate and decide on a single concrete issue. It appears when needed and dissolves once the issue is resolved and tasks are closed.

These values don't change because of the new microcommunity belonging - only if the member changes or clarifies his own life values. After gathering microcommunity around some problem, its "Matrix of Values" appears by averaging all its members' individual values concerning the problem. So we got an actual, inclusive, pluralistic basement to understand the microcommunity needs and values which can be used for all further ISR estimations.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>
    <b>1. Baseline Reference:</b> The aggregated values serve as the community's shared baseline for what matters in this issue<br>
    <b>2. Influence Weighting:</b> When calculating ISR influence scores (Expertise, Contribution, Relevance), 
    the community's Vector of Values determines Contribution, providing a badrock of actions assessment<br>
    <b>3. Holistic Assessment:</b> Rather than imposing external criteria, the framework reflects what this specific microcommunity actually values for this specific issue<br>
    <b>4. Accountability:</b> Members see their collective values reflected in decision-making processes, ensuring decisions align with community priorities<br><br>
    <b>Key Principle:</b> The Vector ensures pluralism by averaging diverse perspectives rather than erasing them.

        <p>The next three elements make up the ISR as constituent parts</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/images/a3.svg" alt="ISR Score Calculation Model" width="100%"><br>
  <center><b>Key ISR Principle</b></center>
  <p>
    Unlike traditional "one-person-one-vote" systems, each member's influence coefficient varies based on:<br>
    ▪ Their contextual connection to the issue <br>
    ▪ Their proven track record of contribution <br>
    ▪ Their actual expertise in the issue domain <br><br>
    AI determine the weight (w<sub>R</sub>, w<sub>E</sub>, w<sub>C</sub>) through the issue context.
  </p>
</div>

                <h4>1. Context Relevance (R)</h4>
                <p>Measures how directly a person is connected to the current issue: declared interests, proximity (geographic or organizational), recent activity on similar topics, social ties to other stakeholders. Practically this is estimated via semantic matching between the issue description and the participant's profile plus graph-based proximity metrics. The calculation method is shown above. </p>

                <h4>2. Expertise (E)</h4>
                <p>Captures domain knowledge: formal credentials, demonstrated experience, and prior successful work relevant to the topic. Expertise is assessed by matching profile records of participant <b>i</b> against the question <b>q</b> semantic vector:
\[
\begin{align*}
{E}_{i,q} = \sum_{credentials} \, \vec{v}_{i, credentials} \cdot \vec{V}_q + \sum_{experience} \, \vec{v}_{i, experience} \cdot \vec{V}_q
\end{align*}
\]
where:
<li>\({E}_{i,q}\) - <b>Expertise</b> about <b>q</b> question of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\({credentials}\) - <b>education</b> records of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\({experience}\) - practical <b>experience</b> records of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\(\vec{v}_{i, credentials}, \vec{v}_{i, experience}\) - vector representation of Expertise records</li>
<li>\(\vec{V}_q\) - vector representation of <b>q</b> question</li></p>
<p>This ensures that members with relevant knowledge have a proportionate influence on decisions related to their expertise. E.g. two records of 2 years experience should weigh the same as one record of 4 year experience; one college degree should weigh more than two short courses; college degree and two short courses should weigh less the PhD degree.
</p>

                <h4>3. Contribution (C)</h4>
                <p>Reflects the participant's verified <b>history of actions</b> in the community — tasks completed, constructive discussion, verified outcomes, and peer evaluations. Contribution is the system's operational "karma" measure: actions and their impact are recorded and vectorized so the AI can evaluate alignment with the community's declared values.</p>
                <p>After calculating the situational <b>Relevance</b>, a list of <b>n</b> microcommunity participants appears with the corresponding weights \(R_i\) regarding relevance to the question <b>q</b>. Vector representations of their values \(\vec{V}_i\) (taking into account <b>Relevance</b>) make up the microcommunity value vector, which can also be translated into a form convenient for the participant with explanations from the AI assistant. Therefore, the greater the <b>Relevance</b> of a member, the more the member's values influence <b>the values of the microcommunity</b>.</p>
                <p>Microcommunity <b>Vector of Values</b> calculation:
\[
\begin{align*}
\vec{V}_{\mathrm{mv}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \, R_i \cdot \vec{V}_i
\end{align*}
\]
where:
<li>\(\vec{V}_{\mathrm{mv}}\) - the microcommunity's <b>Vector of Values</b></li>
<li>\(R_i\) - <b>Relevance</b> of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\(\vec{V}_i\) - vectorized <b>values</b> of <b>i</b> member</li>
</p>
                <p><b>Contribution</b> calculation:
\[
\begin{align*}
{C}_i = \sum_{actions} \, \vec{V}_{\mathrm{mv}} \cdot \vec{v}_{i, action}
\end{align*}
\]
where:
<li>\({C}_i\) - <b>Contribution</b> to the microcommunity of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\({actions}\) - <b>action</b> records of <b>i</b> member</li>
<li>\(\vec{V}_{\mathrm{mv}}\) - the microcommunity's <b>Vector of Values</b></li>
<li>\(\vec{v}_{i, action}\) - vectorized <b>actions</b> of <b>i</b> member</li>
</p>
                <p>Finally ISR is normalized to unit mean (microcommunity average score is always 1) to psychologically simplify adaptation to the new approach.</p>

      <div id="content-CALCULATION" class="content" style="display: none;">
        <h4>Data sources</h4>
        <p>
          ISR uses community-provided profile entries, recorded activity (discussions, tasks, votes), optionally integrated external sources
          (when permitted), and the community's declared values matrix. All action records include contextual metadata (timestamps, links to issues, attachments).
        </p>

        <h4>AI & embeddings</h4>
        <p>
          The system uses semantic embeddings (LLM embeddings) to compare issue texts with user profiles and past actions, compute relevance
          scores, and assist in extracting stakeholders and generating explainable summaries. For tasks such as argument quality or sentiment,
          specialized LLM modules analyze contributions to estimate constructive behaviour.
        </p>

        <h4>Normalization & weights</h4>
        <p>
          Each raw component (relevance, expertise, contribution) is normalized into [0,1]. The community or an automated context routine proposes
          weights w<sub>R</sub>, w<sub>E</sub>, w<sub>C</sub> (sum = 1) appropriate to the issue. The final ISR is the weighted sum described earlier.
        </p>

        <h4>Audit & explainability</h4>
        <p>
          For transparency, the system stores: the component values, a short natural-language explanation of the top contributing factors,
          and links to the records used. Higher-level permission holders in the microcommunity (per adaptable authorization rules) can view
          supporting evidence.

      <div id="content-ADAPTABLE_AUTH" class="content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          ISR includes an adaptable authorization model: access to personal data is not simply role-based but depends on the requestor's
          ISR/gISR score, the sensitivity level of the requested resource, the relationship between accessor and subject, and the declared purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Access is tiered (public results → microcommunity participation → ISR explanations → supporting evidence → activity logs → expertise profiles → social relations → full personal archive). Each tier requires a higher gISR and/or closer relationship in the microcommunity context. Access is logged and logged events feed into behavior signals that may affect future ISR values.
        </p>

        <p>
          The adaptable authorization policy balances transparency and privacy while making misuse auditable and socially accountable.

          Important design choices to protect participants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layered disclosure:</strong> sensitive information is revealed only to those with appropriate ISR/contextual justification.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit trails:</strong> every data access attempt is logged and visible to appropriate stewards; misuse lowers ISR over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Community control:</strong> communities define their values and can tune weights and thresholds (no hidden global algorithm override).</li>
          <li><strong>Explainability:</strong> every score includes a short natural language explanation and links to the records used.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These governance measures are designed to keep the system accountable to the communities that use it and to make trade-offs explicit rather than opaque.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Frequently asked questions (short)</h3>
      <h4>Q: Is ISR a vote-rigging tool?</h4>
      <p>A: No. ISR is a contextually weighted influence mechanism meant to reflect relevance, expertise and contribution. Communities set weights and can inspect calculations. The goal is to improve deliberation quality and legitimacy.</p>

      <h4>Q: Can someone "buy" influence?</h4>
      <p>A: Influence is derived from recorded behavior, verifiable actions, and declared expertise — not from financial transactions. Any integration with external sources must be authorized by the community and logged.</p>

      <h4>Q: What if contributors manipulate their profiles?</h4>
      <p>A: The platform detects suspicious, inconsistent edits and unusual access patterns; repeated manipulations are penalized in the contribution component and may reduce ISR.</p>
