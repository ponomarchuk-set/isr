<h2>1. The shock</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/shocked.png" class="img-left" alt="Shocked face" width="250">
  For someone who lived in 2025, suddenly found themselves in 2080 and after the first few “ahs” days trying to figure out how everything works here - it's a shock. And chaos.<br/>
  It seems that there is no education system, no courts, no central media, no other government institutions. There are no governments and states themselves either. Money has remained only as museum and collector's items. If you want pizza, you just have to express your desire, then specify whether to deliver it to you or take you to some pizzeria - and that's it.<br/>
  Of course, if your <b>ISR</b> is not in the "red zone"...
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>2. The last war</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/war.png" class="img-right" alt="last war" width="250">
  The event that began the countdown of the new era is considered to be the dissolution of the World Government in 2062, after the defeat in the 7-day war. This was the last fact that proved the effectiveness of the <b>Metacommunity</b>, which replaced the archaic centralized system of power, which had once also replaced the archaic tribal system.<br/>
  After the victory in the economic, cultural and educational spheres, the test of war was the last exam that the <b>community system</b> passed to prove that it was the next step in the social evolution of humanity.<br/>
  But it all started, of course, much earlier.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>3. Infrastructure</h2>
<h3>Data Clouds & AI</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/iden2.png" class="img-left" alt="autentification" width="250">
  Since the beginning of the 21st century, social monitoring systems, constantly becoming more complex and expanding, have led to the formation of gigantic repositories filled with a wide variety of <b>information about specific individuals and about society as a whole</b>.<br/>
  Developing in geometric progression, increasingly advanced methods of storing and processing information, as well as devices that became additional sources of this information, appeared.<br/>
  At the end of the 20s, models of general AI appeared, which gave an incredible opportunity to aggregate and process this data.
</p>
<br>

<h3>IoT (Internet of Things)</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/clothe.jpg" class="img-right" alt="smart clothes" width="250">
  The global Internet and cloud storage, specialized and general artificial intelligence, surveillance cameras and satellite constellations, smart clothing and various gadgets, genetic and other methods of personal identification - already in the 2030s, they created a solid technical foundation for the future social revolution.<br/>
  By the way. In the future, no one walks around with computers anymore: you press your finger to any information device - and <b>your operating system with your data is assembled on the fly where you are</b>.<br/>
<b>Blockchain</b> once opened up such an opportunity.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/block.png" class="img-left" alt="blockchain" width="280">
  It took humanity two full generations - from the first widely known implementation (Bitcoin) to one of the two pillars of the technological engine of the modern social system (<b>ISR</b>) - to fully integrate <b>Blockchain</b> into their daily lives through crises of distrust and fear, as it once integrated electricity.<br/>
  During this time, the necessary infrastructure was created, models and protocols were invented for specific tasks, and most importantly - a critical mass of the population adapted their psyche to the main feature of the technology - transparency. Thus, humanity has the technical opportunity to build a <b>society based not on fear, but on trust</b>.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>4. Index of Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/rose.jpg" class="img-left" alt="responsibility" width="180">
  The basis of the new community was a <b>new implementation of the idea of equality</b>. People are equal in their potential, but in specific cases they have different levels of expertise, different skills and different history of interaction with society. Therefore, the influence of a specific person (through voting) on a specific case must be weighed.<br/>
  The main characteristic of a person in the new society is the <strong>Index of Social Responsibility (ISR)</strong> - a universal rating that is used to determine the degree of influence of a person in each social interaction, and which is affected by each social action of an individual.<br/>
<b>ISR</b> is calculated automatically using AI, since:
  <ul>
    <li>it must take into account a very large number of various factors based on the <b>Matrix of Values</b>;</li>
    <li>it must be objective.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>Each person's <b>ISR</b> is stored in the <b>blockchain</b> on distributed servers, which guarantees the possibility and transparency of auditing.
</p>
<p class="has-float"></p>
<br>

<h3>ISR: Components</h3>
<div class="row">
<p><b>Future:</b><br/>
Takes into account factors of the potential value of an individual for the future of the community: the position for which the person is elected by the community, the area of professional expertise, biological characteristics and skills, etc.<br/>
Calculated for each specific case according to the “closeness” of the person to this case.
</p>
<img class="inline-row" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/isr2.jpg" alt="ISR parts" width="250">
<p>
<b>Past:</b><br/>
"Social Karma" is the integral result of evaluating all previous social actions of an individual according to the <b>Matrix of Values</b>. It is updated as new data about the individual's actions appear.<br/>
The results of past actions can also be reevaluated if the community makes changes to the Matrix of Values or to the AI model.
</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<h3>Matrix of Values</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/bvi.jpg" class="img-right" alt="BVI" width="450">
<b>Artificial intelligence</b> has become the second pillar of <b>ISR</b>, since without it it would be impossible to take into account the multidimensional interaction of each person, thereby forming a social Matrix of Values with millions of different factors.<br/>
  Thus, the model of <b>digital democracy</b> was implemented: when everyone directly interacts with other people, and does so quickly, accurately and dispassionately.<br/>
  However, the evaluation criteria are determined exclusively by the community through the distribution of their own votes.<br/>
  This influences the values of the community, and <b>AI</b>, in accordance with these values, makes an <b>objective assessment of everyone</b>.<br/>
  So, as a socio-political practice, <b>populism has died</b>. At last.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>5. The Last Empire</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/disloyal.jpg" class="img-left" alt="disloyal" width="250">
  During the 30s-50s, the <b>World Government</b> (China, South Korea and the remnants of the Russian Federation) consolidated around itself all supporters of the authoritarian approach. They also used automated population monitoring systems, but the evaluation criteria were set by the power institutions - to identify, control and "re-educate" the disloyal.<br/>
  At the same time, the widespread implementation of <b>ISR</b> in public organizations and general AI services demonstrated its effectiveness and strengthened the public's trust in the new metric.<br/>
<b>Communities</b>, as ISR-based associations began to be called, were formed all over the world, which did not need centralized leadership and took away market after market from authoritarianism.<br/>
  So the conflict was inevitable.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>6. Community</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/mc.png" class="img-right" alt="community" width="250">
  Each person in the community system has <b>only one account</b> with a complex (genetic included) identification of the person.<br/>
  A microcommunity <b>is formed automatically</b> around some public issue or case from all the people involved in it. And it <b>is also automatically disbanded</b> after the case is over. Thus, each person can be involved in <b>many microcommunities</b> at the same time, in which they will have different roles and weight (for example: an electrical engineer, a resident of Kudryavsky Boulevard, a father of two sons), and participation in which will affect their <b>ISR</b>.<br/>
  The more global the issue, the more people are involved in it, and the larger the community. Up to the <b>Metacommunity</b>.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>7. The End of Social Hierarchy</h2>
<p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/crisis.jpg" class="img-left" alt="hierarchy" width="250">
Thus, the community system implemented the <b>horizontal</b> principle of social association of citizens, which made the entire hierarchy of representative power with all its institutions redundant. And it:
<ol>
  <li>Allowed the <b>release</b> of huge <b>resources</b> that were previously spent on supporting this hierarchy and its infrastructure</li>
  <li><b>Eliminated errors</b> in the transmission of information between levels</li>
</ol>
Power hereditary, corruption, abuse of power - in the community all this became a thing of the past.<br/>
<b>All this ensured GDP growth of up to 25% per year</b> (versus hierarchical 5% at best)
</p><p class="has-float"></p>
<br>

<h2>8. Society 2050</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/future1.png" class="img-right" alt="future" width="250">
Law and order, medicine, education, arbitration and even the armed forces have become simply specialized communities.<br/>
The performance of <b>functional duties</b> in them is occupied by people who are involved by voting of the entire community.<br/> 
And since the distribution of community resources among citizens depends on the level of utility, the ISR has also begun to perform the <b>function of money</b>.<br/>
The boundaries of <b>private life</b> have finally become a real value, since their unlawful violation entails a <b>fine</b> to the personal ISR.<br/>
Mental disorders have become an exception, since their <b>basis</b> - the <b>fear</b> inspired by society - has <b>disappeared</b>.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>9. Choice + Responsibility = Freedom</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/choice.png" class="img-left" alt="freedom" width="250">
  I can live like a parasite - lie on the couch and have fun - the economy of robotic factories will feed me without problems (experiments with <b>basic income</b> began at the beginning of the 21st century). This is my own choice and here, in the future, it will be respected like any other.<br/>
  But, in this case, my ISR <b>will not allow</b> me to have any significant <b>impact</b> on public life.<br/>
  Because being useful to someone is the only way to raise ISR. And it is such people who should determine the future of society.<br/>
  And the main anchor stone of the social system has become <b>individual responsibility</b> for both one's actions and inaction.
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>10. Humanity mirror</h2>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/society2050/future2.png" class="img-right" alt="pole" width="250">
  An unexpected side effect was the systematic analysis of the <b>Matrix of Values</b>. This resulted in the greatest experiment in practical psychology in the history of mankind, since the data were collected and analyzed in real time, taking into account the largest list of factors and on the largest possible sample.<br/>
  Since then, it shows mankind the dynamics of its <b>true motives</b> - and helps to understand more and more deeply who we are, where we are going and why.
