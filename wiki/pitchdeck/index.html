  <h1>ISR - Index of Social Responsibility</h1>

<h2>One Minute Pitch</h2>
<p>ISR is solving decision paralysis and unfair voting bias for non‑profits, cooperatives & civic DAOs.</p>

<b>Problem</b>
<p>
Today, non‑profit & civic leaders struggle with outdated “one‑person‑one‑vote” systems—costing them about 30% of project budgets in delays and mis‑allocation.
</p>

<b>Solution</b>
<p>
We are building an AI‑powered influence‑weighted voting platform that delivers an evidence‑based meritocracy no competitor offers through real‑time “ISR scores” that weight each member’s vote by expertise, contributions and context.
</p>

<b>Market</b>
<p>
This is a $6B civic‑tech & nonprofit software market growing about 8% annually.
</p>

<b>Ask</b>
<p>
We’re raising $1.5M seed to roll out ISR to 200 paying organizations and reach $1M ARR in 18 months.
</p>

<h2>One Minute Pitch (Verbal)</h2>
<p>
Imagine a world where every community member’s voice is heard not just by volume, but by value.<br>
That’s what the Index of Social Responsibility (ISR) platform delivers.
We’re tackling a huge problem: nonprofits, co-ops, DAOs and civic groups struggle to make fair decisions because one-person-one-vote fails to account for expertise and trust.
Our AI-driven, decentralized platform calculates a dynamic influence score for each member – based on their social contributions, personal competencies, and context relevance – and uses it to weight votes intelligently.
The result? Decisions that truly reflect the community’s values and know-how, not just popularity.
It’s like PageRank for people, enabling smarter collective choices.
With over 10 million NGOs and civic organizations globally and digital transformation sweeping the sector (89% say digital communication is critical), the timing is perfect.
Our business model is a scalable SaaS with a mission-driven twist: basic tools free for small groups and advanced analytics for paid tiers.
<!-- We have a passionate team of civic-tech and AI experts, an MVP ready for pilot, and early partners on board. -->
ISR will revolutionize community governance, empowering organizations to be more transparent, efficient, and impactful.
Join us in turning social responsibility into tangible, data-driven influence.

<h2>Deck</h2>

<h3>Problem – Ineffective Community Governance</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/pitchdeck/image1.png" class="img-right" alt="People voting" width="250">
Millions of nonprofits, cooperatives, and civic groups lack fair decision-making tools, often relying on simplistic votes or top-down choices.<br>
There is no clear, objective way to measure a member's social value or credibility in decisions, causing conflicts and lost trust.
</p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>Solution – ISR Platform</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/pitchdeck/image6.png" class="img-left" alt="" width="250">
Decentralized, AI-Assisted Governance:<br>
ISR (Index of Social Responsibility) is a platform for collective decision-making that weights each member's vote by their proven contributions and expertise.<br>
It's like an "AI referee" ensuring community decisions reflect quality, not just quantity.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<table border="0">
<tr>
  <td>
  <b>Social Contribution:</b> A running tally of the member’s contributions and positive feedback (their reputation in the community).
  <br><br>
  <b>Situational Relevance:</b> Context-specific factors, like stake or activity in the current topic (only relevant voices carry extra weight on a given decision).
</td>
<td align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/pitchdeck/image4.png" class="img-right" alt="People voting" width="200">
</td>
<td>
  <b>Personal Competence:</b> Relevant skills, experience, or credentials that the community values (expertise that matters for the topics at hand).
  <br><br>
  <b>Weighted Decision-Making:</b> When the community votes or gives input, the platform uses these scores to calculate an outcome that is meritocratic. This hybridizes democracy and meritocracy.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<h3>Outcome – Stronger Communities</h3>
<p class="has-float">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ponomarchuk-set/isr/main/wiki/pitchdeck/image7.png" class="img-right" alt="" width="250">
With the ISR platform, organizations get increased engagement (members know their efforts matter), faster consensus (less deadlock when credible voices guide decisions), and more accountable leadership (influence is earned, not given).<br>
Transparency and Adaptability: All weighting criteria and calculations are transparent – members can see how ISR scores are formed according to community-defined values.<br>
The system is adaptive: as values or goals change, the weighting formula can be tuned by the community.

<h3>Business Model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Freemium SaaS Approach:</b> Core features free for small communities (e.g. basic voting and karma tracking for grassroots groups), lowering the barrier for widespread use in the nonprofit world.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Premium Subscription Tiers:</b> Revenue comes from subscription plans for organizations that need advanced capabilities:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Standard SaaS Tier:</b> Per-user or per-org monthly subscription unlocking advanced AI analytics (e.g. deeper insight into member contributions, predictive engagement suggestions), customization of weighting formulas, and priority support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enterprise & Government Licenses:</b> Custom contracts for large NGOs, networks, or civic institutions that require on-premise deployment, integration with internal systems, dedicated AI model tuning, or white-label offerings.
      </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>

  <tr>
    <th>Criteria</th>
    <th>LiquidFeedback (open-source)</th>
    <th>Pol.is (open-source)</th>
    <th>Bloomfire (commercial)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Focus/Tagline</b></td>
    <td>
      Democratic Decision-Making – Platform for proposals + votes with liquid democracy (vote delegation).
    </td>
    <td>
      Real-time Conversation Analysis – Large-scale discussion tool using ML to find opinion clusters and consensus.
    </td>
    <td>
      AI-Powered Knowledge Management – Corporate knowledge sharing platform with AI search & Q&A.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Core Functionality</b></td>
    <td>
      Voting & Delegation: Members propose initiatives, discuss, and vote. Supports delegating votes to trusted members for topics (enhancing informed voting). No AI, rules-based weighting.
    </td>
    <td>
      Opinion Mapping: Crowd input via surveys/comments; uses machine learning to cluster similar opinions and highlight agreement/divergence.
    </td>
    <td>
      Knowledge Base & Q&A: Central repository for org knowledge; AI-powered search and recommendations to retrieve answers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Positioning vs. ISR</b></td>
    <td>
      Closest in intent to ISR but ISR goes further by automatically weighting influence using data, rather than manual delegation. Also, ISR’s AI-driven scoring adapts per context; LiquidFeedback is manual and static in comparison.
    </td>
    <td>
      More complementary than directly competing – Pol.is finds what people think; ISR uses that alongside member scores to drive a vote.
    </td>
    <td>
      Indirect competitor – some organizations might try to use forums for decision support. ISR can integrate with such forums to inform scoring. We stand apart by focusing on decision outcomes, not just information storage.
    </td>
