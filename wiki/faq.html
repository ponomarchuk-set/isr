            <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Q: Doesn't ISR just recreate inequality?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> No. ISR makes inequality <strong>transparent and justified</strong>. Unlike popularity contests or 
                top-down hierarchies, ISR weights are based on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Expertise relevant to the specific issue (not general power)</li>
                    <li>Proven commitment to community values (not inherited status)</li>
                    <li>Direct relevance to the decision (not blanket authority)</li>
                </ul>
                All members can see how scores are calculated and can build influence through contribution.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: What if someone disagrees with how their ISR is calculated?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR is fully transparent. Members can:
                <ul>
                    <li>See exactly which factors contributed to their score</li>
                    <li>Ask the AI assistant for explanations</li>
                    <li>Provide additional information about expertise or experience</li>
                    <li>Appeal to the community if they believe calculations are unfair</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Q: Can ISR be manipulated?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR has built-in safeguards:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contribution scores require <strong>consistent, long-term</strong> alignment with values</li>
                    <li>Sudden changes in behavior or values declarations trigger system warnings</li>
                    <li>Expertise is cross-checked against verifiable credentials</li>
                    <li>Community can adjust weighting formula if they detect gaming</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Q: Is ISR only for large organizations?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> No. ISR scales from small communities (10 members) to large networks (100,000+ members). Really helpful it begans from 150+ members (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's number</a>). Where, on the one hand, social dynamics become complex enough to need structured decision-making because of values diversity growing, on the other hand, participants cannot easily behold, keep in mind and take into account all the skills and actions of other participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: How do we set community values?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> Matrix of Values is flexible and member-driven. It gathers out of all microcommunity members' inputs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Each community member defines its values in Profile in a convinient way</li>
                    <li>AI assistant helps translate values into operational definitions and, vice-versa, helps to understand what the system means by this definitions</li>
                    <li>Values can be adjusted over time</li>
                    <li>All members can see how their actions align with stated values</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Q: How does ISR prevent social fragmentation and encourage participation?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR addresses atomization by creating dynamic microcommunities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Microcommunities are formed around specific issues (dreams, questions, problems), not static social groups - it insures real actual involvement into the process</li>
                    <li>Membership changes as problems evolve, keeping engagement fresh</li>
                    <li>Transparent decision-making builds trust in open communication</li>
                    <li>Absence of bureaucratic barriers allows instant community formation when needed</li>
                    <li>Every member has fair influence levers regardless of background</li>
                </ul>
                This counters the "internal emigration" tendency by making participation rewarding and meaningful.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: What about privacy? Does ISR track all my actions?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR respects privacy while ensuring accountability:
                <ul>
                    <li>Only actions affecting others are considered "social actions" and can be evaluated</li>
                    <li>Information access is tiered based on relevance using Adaptable authorization (family, doctor, neighbor have different access levels)</li>
                    <!-- <li>Proof of Identity mechanisms allow pseudonymity when desired</li> -->
                    <li>Healthy community dynamics reduce the need for anonymity by creating safe expression spaces</li>
                </ul>
                The goal is not surveillance, but creating environments where people feel secure being authentic.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: How does ISR differ from money-based systems?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR addresses limitations of monetary systems:
                <ul>
                    <li>Money measures everything in monetary terms, but ISR measures social contribution</li>
                    <li>Money can be acquired without social value creation; ISR requires actual contribution</li>
                    <li>ISR weights are context-specific while money provides blanket influence</li>
                    <li>Money creates incentives to accumulate regardless of method; ISR rewards aligned actions</li>
                </ul>
                ISR complements economic systems by adding a social contribution dimension to influence.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: Can't AI make mistakes in evaluating human behavior?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR's approach to AI evaluation is designed for fairness:
                <ul>
                    <li>We're already constantly evaluated by others, exams, certifications - ISR just makes it transparent</li>
                    <li>The evaluation algorithm is open for inspection and adjustment by the community</li>
                    <li>Historical data shows AI often outperforms humans in consistent pattern recognition</li>
                    <li>Multiple perspectives (community input + AI analysis) reduce individual biases</li>
                    <li>All evaluations can be discussed, contested, and refined by the community</li>
                </ul>
                The system evolves through collective intelligence, not rigid AI imposition.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: How does ISR handle different types of community members?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR's flexible architecture accommodates diverse participation:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Experts:</strong> Higher weights in their domain areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Active contributors:</strong> Build influence through consistent participation</li>
                    <li><strong>New members:</strong> Start with baseline weights that grow with contribution</li>
                    <li><strong>Occasional participants:</strong> Influence limited to areas they engage with</li>
                    <li><strong>Special cases:</strong> Parents, retirees, students receive contextual consideration</li>
                </ul>
                This mirrors real-world social dynamics where influence is earned, not assumed.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: What prevents ISR from becoming another controlling bureaucracy?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR's design prevents bureaucratic calcification:
                <ul>
                    <li>Algorithm is transparent and community-adjustable (like adjusting radio settings)</li>
                    <li>No pre-set values - each community defines its own values</li>
                    <li>Microcommunities dissolve when their purpose is fulfilled</li>
                    <li>Weight calculations are issue-specific, not permanent status assignments</li>
                    <li>System adapts as community values and needs evolve</li>
                </ul>
                ISR is a tool, not a ruler - the community determines how it's used.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Q: How does ISR work in residential communities like housing cooperatives?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR is particularly effective for housing communities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparent decision-making reduces conflicts over repairs and renovations</li>
                    <li>Technical decisions weight experts more, aesthetic decisions involve broader input</li>
                    <li>Payment responsibility calculations consider usage and benefit</li>
                    <li>Conflict resolution incorporates relationship history and community values</li>
                    <li>Resource allocation (parking, common spaces) based on demonstrable need and contribution</li>
                </ul>
                This addresses common housing cooperative problems like "loudest voice wins" and "equal votes for unequal expertise."
            </p> -->

            <!-- <h3>Q: What's the minimum viable implementation for testing ISR?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> A basic ISR implementation includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>User profiles with demographic and expertise information</li>
                    <li>Personal values declaration</li>
                    <li>Discussion forums with AI-relevance filtering</li>
                    <li>Voting with weighted influence calculation</li>
                    <li>Task tracking for implementation follow-through</li>
                    <li>AI assistant for system explanations</li>
                </ul>
                This can be hosted on Firebase with 100-200 users to test social dynamics.
            </p> -->

            <h3>Q: How does ISR ensure representation of minority views?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A:</strong> ISR protects minority participation through:
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct relevance weighting gives niche experts influence in their domains</li>
                    <li>Microcommunity formation around specific concerns prevents majoritarian domination</li>
                    <li>Values declaration ensures diverse perspectives are recognized in community ethos</li>
                    <li>Transparent algorithms allow identification and correction of bias</li>
                    <li>Historical contribution recognition prevents "tyranny of the majority"</li>
                </ul>
                The goal is constructive diversity, not homogenized consensus.
            </p>
